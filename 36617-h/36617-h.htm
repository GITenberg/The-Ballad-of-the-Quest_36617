  THE BALLAD OF THE QUEST
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Some day," I said, "before Life is over,<BR>
I will shut my house door, and will be a rover."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Under the sky where the great stars roll,<BR>
I will search for my faith, and search for my soul.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I have fared without them this many a day<BR>
Through the market-place of the world's high-way.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The truth I gave in exchange for a lie,<BR>
And I bartered my dreams to a passer-by.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I have met Delilah,&mdash;her enchantments I know<BR>
As the man of strength knew them ages ago.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Fool's gold and fool's joy have been my reaping,<BR>
And my heart has nothing that's worth the keeping.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But the world is wide and the world is free,<BR>
And the things I have lost may come back to me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I will follow the path of the bird that flies,<BR>
And look for a woman with honest eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
If I travel hard, and travel alone,<BR>
I may overtake Peace, and make it my own.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Only the Sun and the Moon's sweet light<BR>
Shall mark my day, or measure my night.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Silks and satins and embroidered things,<BR>
I'll exchange for blossoms and butter-flies' wings.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And under a thorn-hedge I will dine<BR>
On a handful of berries, as red as wine.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Or I'll earn my bread on the out-bound ships,<BR>
With the sun in my eyes, and salt on my lips.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And for the softness of beds and pillows,<BR>
I'll take a hammock that swings with the billows.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It may be the trail will lead me afar<BR>
To mountain paths, where the wild sheep are.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Or with simple people, and free from guile,<BR>
I will pitch my tent and will rest awhile.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am weary of softness and things of ease,<BR>
And weary of Scribes, and of Pharisees.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
On a morning road where the wind is strong,<BR>
I may learn again to whistle a song.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Down forest paths, or the ways of the sea,<BR>
My soul and my faith may come back to me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And always and ever beneath the skies,<BR>
I will look for a woman with honest eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I will follow no will at all but my own,<BR>
And the road I take I will take alone.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Some day," I said, "before Life is over,<BR>
I will shut my house door, and will be a rover."<BR>

II<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But the day when it came was a troubled day,<BR>
And the road I took was a troubled way.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then never a will I had of my own,<BR>
And never a step did I travel alone.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We marched by day, and we marched by night,<BR>
Through the Sun's hot gold, or the Moon's cool light.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We marched with laughter, we marched with song,<BR>
Or in dreadful silence we marched along.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The man at my right cursed low at his fate,<BR>
The man at my left smiled early and late.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the faces I saw at the edge of day,<BR>
Were young, young faces, turned old and grey.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The field where poppies flashed red in the wheat,<BR>
Was a hell we tramped through on stumbling feet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I forgot I had said "before Life is over,<BR>
I will shut my house door, and will be a rover."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Out on the roads where the guns took toll<BR>
I gave little heed to my faith, or my soul.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the trenches where only the dead could rest,<BR>
Life was a candle-flame&mdash;Death was a jest.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The stars swung round in a blood-red sky,<BR>
And the earth was red where the men reeled by.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I laughed&mdash;for I was living and strong,&mdash;<BR>
And I tossed them the line of a battle song.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
May-day came in,&mdash;but the sweet o' the Spring,&mdash;<BR>
Who should know there was any such thing?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For the lovers were gone, who used to know<BR>
The English lanes where the hawthorns blow&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the lovers from lands far over the sea,&mdash;<BR>
Ah!  The watching moon only, knew where they might be.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I shook my impotent hand at the sky,<BR>
And travelled on with a battle cry.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
III<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
On a desperate night&mdash;bitter black with pain,&mdash;<BR>
My soul returned to haunt me again.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We two kept vigil till break of day,<BR>
But the moon bore witness, I did not pray.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I dreamt I drifted with a name on my lips,<BR>
Where the clouds were sea waves, and the stars little ships.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I dreamt,&mdash;and lay on the shell-bitten sod,<BR>
Like a thing that had been forgotten of God.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I saw the smoke of the battle roll<BR>
Over many a swift departing soul,&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But when the dawn was a violet tide,<BR>
A shadow came and knelt at my side.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No&mdash;not a shadow&mdash;or mystery&mdash;<BR>
But a rose of the darkness, she came to me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Mist-grey was her gown, and about her head<BR>
Was a shining band with a cross of red.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her eyes were closed, for she dared not see<BR>
What the guns and the dark had made of me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So I caught her gown in fear she would pass,<BR>
Like a lovely shadow, across the grass.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Who are you?" I cried, "who have found me here<BR>
Where I have lain, this year upon year?"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"No!  No! but one night, beloved,"&mdash;she said,<BR>
"While I searched for you all among the dead.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"But you were so strong you could not die,<BR>
Though Azrael touched you as he passed by."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then by a flame that lit up the skies,<BR>
I looked once again in Delilah's eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They had out-lived fear, and were sweet, and deep<BR>
As the eyes of an Angel, who bringeth sleep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"O brave one!" she said, "You soon shall see<BR>
From your thirst and your pain I can set you free!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Here!  The water flask!&mdash;I will lift your head,&mdash;<BR>
Drink if you will, and spare not," she said.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Be patient, and wait!  See here in your arm,<BR>
The poppies of God shall work their charm."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So she spoke, while her voice seemed faint and far<BR>
As though it drifted down from a star.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I have come," she faltered, "belovéd at last"&mdash;<BR>
"Even so"&mdash;I said, "from the long-gone past.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I would know," I cried, "how you came to me<BR>
Through this hell where no woman should ever be?"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I heard you call," she answered, "and then<BR>
I followed the road of the out-bound men.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I followed the bearers, for far&mdash;and far,&mdash;<BR>
They travel wherever the wounded are.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Picket and sentry, and the men who fly,<BR>
Made the holy sign as I hurried by."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Here and there where the grass was red,<BR>
I stopped for a moment beside the dead.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I pressed my lips to their tunic's hem,&mdash;<BR>
And often I folded the hands of them.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"But I could not stay,&mdash;and when dawn was near,<BR>
You called again&mdash;and I found you here."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"O Sweet&mdash;no more!" I said.  "Tell me no more!<BR>
For Peace has come in through the morning's door.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"There is only this at the end of my quest&mdash;<BR>
Only you&mdash;and Love&mdash;and a spirit at rest."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then came the bearers to lift me away&mdash;<BR>
But beside me her shadow moved&mdash;tender and grey.<BR>

  A SONG OF POPPIES
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
I love red poppies!  Imperial red poppies!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun-worshippers are they;<BR>
Gladly as trees live through a hundred summers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live one little day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I love red poppies!  Impassioned scarlet poppies!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even their strange perfume<BR>
Seems like an essence brewed by fairy people,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an immortal bloom.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I love red poppies!  Red, silken, swaying poppies!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in their hearts they keep<BR>
A magic cure for woe,&mdash;a draught of Lethe,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lotus-gift of sleep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I love red poppies!  Soft silver-stemmed, red poppies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from the rain and sun,<BR>
Gather a balm to heal some earth-born sorrow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their glad day is done.<BR>

  THE SHEPHERD WIND

<P CLASS="poem">
When hills and plains are powdered white,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter cold the north wind blows,<BR>
Upon my window in the night<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fairy-garden grows.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here lilies that no hand hath sown<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom white as foam upon the sea,<BR>
And elfin bells to earth unknown,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold frost-bound melody.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And here are blossoms like to stars<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangled in nets of silver lace,&mdash;<BR>
My very breath their beauty mars,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stirs them from their place.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Perchance the echoes of old songs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found here a resting place at last,<BR>
With drifting perfume, that belongs<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To roses of the past,&mdash;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Or all the moonbeams that were lost<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On summer nights the world forgets,<BR>
May here be prisoned by the frost,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With souls of violets.<BR>

The wind doth shepherd many things,&mdash;<BR>

Out in the silence of the mountain passes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart makes peace and liberty its own,&mdash;<BR>

His robes are dappled like the moonlit seas,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As down the dusk he steps from star to star.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Above the world he swings his curfew bell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep falls soft on golden heads and white;<BR>
The daisies curl their leaves beneath his spell,&mdash;<BR>
The prisoner who wearies in his cell<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgets awhile, and dreams throughout the night.<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
